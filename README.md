🐾 IoT-Based Animal Intrusion Detection System

An intelligent IoT-powered system that detects animal intrusions in farmlands, sends real-time alerts, and helps farmers protect their crops from damage. This project integrates ESP32-CAM, YOLO-based object detection model, and Twilio API for instant notifications.

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time Monitoring – Continuously captures frames from ESP32-CAM.<br>
✅ AI-powered Detection – Uses YOLO-based deep learning model to detect animals like cows, dogs, elephants, etc.<br>
✅ Instant Alerts – Sends SMS notifications to registered users when intrusion is detected (via Twilio).<br>
✅ User Interface – Simple Tkinter-based GUI for entering camera stream URL and viewing live feed.<br>
✅ Customizable Animal List – Easily modify which animals trigger alerts.<br>
